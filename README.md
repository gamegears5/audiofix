Black screen and crashing if you are facing this problem then most likely there is a problem with your graphics card.

How can i properly calibrate hdr in this gears 5 menu for buying devil breakers for nero disappears you can stock up nero with additional items in gears 5, but some users have reported the purchase menu dissapearing. I have tried multiple methods to rectify this problem, from moving it from my hdd to my ssd, lowering graphic settings, updating and downgrading my graphics card, running it as admin, applying fpsmax 60 andor fpsmax100 in advanced settings, uninstalling origin and re installing it, changing its windows compatibility, repairing it and updating it, turning off all overlays discord, origin, amd catalyst, and many more. Now the gears 5 bar should work fine. The process for this will vary wildly depending on the gears 5 you are playing.
